    /// `registerService()` methods invoked). To find `IOService` objects
    /// that aren't yet registered, use an iterator as created
    /// by `IORegistryEntryCreateIterator()`. `IOServiceAddMatchingNotification`
    /// can also supply this information and install a notification of new
    /// `IOService`s. The matching information used in the matching
    /// dictionary may vary depending on the class of service being looked up.
    ///
    /// - Parameter matchingDictionary: A CF dictionary containing matching
    ///   information, of which one reference is always consumed by this
    ///   function (Note prior to the Tiger release there was a small chance
    ///   that the dictionary might not be released if there was an error
    ///   attempting to serialize the dictionary). IOKitLib can construct
    ///   matching dictionaries for common criteria with helper functions
    ///   such as `IOServiceMatching`, `IOServiceNameMatching`,
    ///   `IOBSDNameMatching`.
    /// - Returns: An iterator handle.
    /// - Throws: `IOError` object.
